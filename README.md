## Problem Statement
The most significant part of a bank is the approval of loans to customers, also it is time-consumed process. Value Trust Bank was founded in 2003 in Germany with the objective of providing loans and finance to individuals and businesses. After three years, the bank was experiencing difficulties in generating profits and dealing with customers who do not repay their loans back. Now, the bank manager wants a software application that will identify the appropriate customers to approve the loan with a lower chance of default, as well as it also helps to reduce the effort and time required to process the applications in order to improve the customer experience.

## Objective
As a data scientist at Value Trust Bank, you must process, analyze, train, develop, and deploy the model to production in order to determine whether or not a customer is at risk. This will help the company in making the correct decisions on risk customers who will not repay the loan back to the bank.
